*** update gfycats set left_fencer_id = NULL, right_fencer_id = NULL, bout_id = NULL;
*** delete from bouts;
*** delete from fencers;
*** delete from fencers_tournaments;
*** alter sequence fencers_tournaments_id_seq restart with 1;
*** alter sequence fencers_id_seq restart with 1;
*** alter sequence bout_id_seq restart with 1;
*** ruby download_tournament_entries.rb
*** rake db:normalize_names

*** DO NOT delete the gfycats table.  There's too much info there that can't be replicated anymore.
